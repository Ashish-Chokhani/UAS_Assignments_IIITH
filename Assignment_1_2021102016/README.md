# Assignment 1 ‚Äì Percolation and Sandpile Models

This assignment explores critical behavior in lattice-based systems.

## üî¨ Questions

1. **2D Percolation**  
   - Study cluster size distributions for varying `p` values across subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes.
   - Use log-binning and log-log plots.
   - Estimate critical exponent at `p = p_c`.

2. **1D Percolation**  
   - Plot Œ†(p; L) for different lattice sizes.
   - Explain and interpret critical behavior and cluster probabilities.
   - Log-log plot of `n_s vs s`.

3. **Sandpile Model**  
   - Simulate avalanche threshold dynamics.
   - Show evolution over time steps (t = 0, 10, 20).
   - Demonstrate pattern stabilization and perturbation response.
